# Dev Snap

A simple system tray app that takes screenshots of all connected displays repeatedly for timelapses. Useful for taking quick shots of work in progress for social media, sending progress reports or updates.

The screenshots are saved in a folder named after the date they were taken.

Within that folder, there is a subfolder for each display, with the screenshots named after the time they were taken.

The app runs in the system tray, and the user can set the interval at which screenshots are taken by right clicking.Supported Platforms : Windows 11
